      <h2>Dear Daughter,</h2>
      <p>Before I start to teach you the fundamentals of how to make an art quilt,
        I want to remind you that I have always and will always be MOM to you,
        but that I have had lots of other roles in my life as NAIDA, which
        contribute to understanding why I love art quilting, as well as how I do it.</p>
      <img class = "right" src="images/baby-baby.jpg"/>
      <h3>Fundamental to my being is the belief that all people in this world come
        from the same source, and that we have been created as individuals with
        particular strengths and characteristics, with crucial roles to fill for
        ourselves, our families and our communities.</h2>
      <p> I like to use a lot of symbolism
        in my artwork because I see meaning in everything. I believe that the
        river of life flows through and connects each of us to each other as we
        move through our time in history. Since art quilts take many hours, I use
        that time to reflect on life, while paying close attention to those
        sharp scissors in my hand!</p>
          <hr>
      <p>Although my formal art education ended when I got married to your father
        after a very brief study of graphic design at the University of Florida
        in 1968, every one of my jobs after that required some degree of artistic
        creativity. My work experiences include time as a bookkeeper, real estate
        broker, graphic designer, advertising agency owner, architectural designer
        and draftsman, marketing consultant, image and branding designer, promotional
        director, interior decorator and, oh yeah, Mom (teacher, chauffeur, softball
        coach, cook, maid and laundress.)</p>

      <p>We bought you your first computer in second grade, and I know that you
        can't imagine that most of my artistic career was spent at an actual wooden
        drawing board where  "cut and paste"  had a sensory meaning.  Feeling the
        smoothness of the vellum paper beneath my  drafting pencil on my wooden
        drawing board, feeling the exacto blade between my fingers and smelling
        the rubber cement...I always loved that sensory experience. So I never
        used a computer in my design career, preferring to use my hands at the
        drawing board.</p>
          <hr>
      <p>Sewing was always a part of my life, but I was never interested in quilting
        with little squares. Aunt Jane gave me a miniature Singer Featherweight
        sewing machine when I was in 9th grade, and I still have it and love using
        it for straight sewing. But what I love now is Art Quilting, and you gave it
        a perfect name -- quilting beyond the squares! It's very fitting that I learned
        this process using a picture of you at Angel Falls as my design inspiration.</p>

      <p>So Art Quilting is my form of artistic expression and I have lots of new tools.
        My engineering scale has been replaced with a plastic quilter's rule, a
        rotary cutter replaces my exacto blade, and fusing fabric replaces rubber
        cement! Fabrics offer me something other art mediums do not.  After designing
        my initial pattern, I move my way around my palette of colorful fabrics, then cut,
        blend and fuse them together on my "canvas" of cotton batting sandwiched between
        two pieces of unbleached muslin fabric. Piece by piece, sometimes itty bitty
        pieces, the design takes shape. </p>

        <p>Finishing my creation is accomplished with
        my "paintbrush" --- the multi-colored  threads on my quilting machine (which
        is about five times bigger than that Singer Featherweight!) where free-motion
        quilting adds a unique perspective and dimension.  I like to think of my medium
        as painting with fabric, with raw-edge applique as my technique.  I find this
        medium best suited to me because of the hands-on approach in combining the tactile
        sensation of touch with the visual expression of colors. New fabrics even test
        the sense of smell.</p>
            <hr>
        <img class = "left" src="images/floral.jpg"/>
      <p>So now I am depending on you to teach me to use technology to bring me into
        your brave new world as I teach you how to take your hands off the keyboard
        and feel the fabric!  I look forward to our continued adventure together on
        this river of life, and promise that I will keep reaching higher as I keep
        getting older. </p>
